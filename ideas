### module support

start from the "entry point" file
source -> AST -> dependencyAnalyzer -> list of filenames
starting from first dependency repeat parsing + dependency analysis recursively, on every step append parsed AST
as node into a dependency tree
use post-order DFS to analyze the tree

module can either be a regular clara module (.clara) or a native JS module (.js + .d.clara)

all value and type declarations from the top level block of a module are "exported"

imports can appear any level of the code


### operators

operators are methods with non-letter name
// a b c
// if b = foo (letters)
// (a foo) c <=> a.apply(foo).apply(c)
// if b = * (non-letters)
// (a.*(c))

examples:
`foo.bar` -> member (foo, member `bar`)
`foo .bar` -> member (foo, member `bar`)
`foo . bar` -> operator (foo, member `.`, apply `bar`)
`foo asd bar` -> apply (foo, apply asd, apply bar)


-------------------
functional type system, case class keyword implemented as macro that is a "template" for making new types
macro is a function in type level


----

std lib

- list.soleHead return the head if list has just one item (combined head + assert length == 1)

---

if-else, ::match

x < 5 then 1 else 0

x < 5 ::match { true => 1, false => 0}

Nullary methods:

::methods Boolean {
  not: => Boolean
}

---

default type for any type (in pattern)
might only make sense for records

(a = 1, b = 1) = fooTuple2

{ a = 1, b = 2 } = fooRecord

(a = 1) = ()


---

Constructor is a first class function

- `::new T` expression returns the function

List of languages to look at for inspiration

Scala, Dotty, TypeScript, Reason/Ocaml, Rust, Swift, Nim, Python, PureScript, JS++

---

Warn about unused values (and types?)

---

implicit ::new

`A` means

1) value `A`
2) if value `A` is not found but there is type `A`, then `::new A`

this is better than:

`f x` means
1) if there's a function value named f in scope -> call f with x
2) else if there's value f in scope with member (property or method) `apply` -> call f.apply with x
3) else if there's type f -> construct new f from x

because if the logic is bound to call, then it would not simply work in something like `.map(A)`

but the apply rule is also useful (points 1, 2, but not 3)

---

replace ::declare ::type / ::declare ::methods with ::trait (determines how methods should be implement elsewhere)

::trait Seq<T> {
  headOption: Maybe<T>
  length: Int
  // should we allow also method implementations?:
  headUnsafe: T = headOption.unwrapUnsafe
}

::type FooSeq<T> = Any // TODO should it be : or := instead of =

::methods FooSeq<T> : Seq<T>, SomeOtherTrait {
  // must implement head here
}

when value is assigned to a trait type, the methods of the actual type is injected into the runtime value for dynamic dispatch

how to define static methods? how to declare them in traits

Rust's supertraits seem useful

::comp Boolean {
  parse = (s: String) => ::match {
    "True" => True
  }
}

how it should look like for user:

foo: Foo = Foo.from(bar) // Foo is type, accessing static method

Bar = {
  ... // akin to Scala's object
}

---

tuples are nested pairs

a <=> (a, ())
(a, b) => (a, (b, ()))
(a, b, c) <=> (a, (b, (c, ())))
etc.

this should simply implementation as analyzer only has to deal with pairs/2-tuples

---

{} vs ()

mathemathically it would be fair to consider empty record and 0-tuple the same but in order to prevent accidents,
they are not assignable to each other

---

things that are written often should have terse syntax

MVP usefulness check:

can we implement Option monad like this:

::data Maybe[A] {
  map[B] = (f: A => B) => ::match {
    ::case Just(value) => Just(f(value))
    ::case None => None
  } ::this
} = Just(value: A) | None

deep copy
how to make this composable? function returning keyword?

::type Address = {
  country: String
  zipCode: String
}
::type User = {
  email: String
  address: Address
}
user = ::new User {
  email = ''
  address = ::new Address {
    country = 'FI'
    zipCode = '00100'
  }
}
updatedUser = ::copy user {
  address.zipCode = 12345
  email = 'foo@bar.invalid'
}
// property list notation:
// {
//   address.zipCode = 12345
//   email = 'foo@bar.invalid'
// }

---

TypeScript output

interface Foo {
  x: number
  y: number
}

const Foo$Methods = {
  area: (a: Foo) => a.x * a.y
}

const foo1: Foo = {
  x: 1,
  y: 2,
}

// const $claraType = Symbol('$claraType')

// interface $ClaraObject {
//     [$claraType]: Symbol
// }

// interface Foo extends $ClaraObject {
//   x: number
//   y: number
// }

// const Foo$Type = Symbol('Foo')

// const Foo$Methods = {
//   area: (a: Foo) => a.x * a.y
// }

// const foo1: Foo = {
//   [$claraType]: Foo$Type,
//   x: 1,
//   y: 2,
// }

== equality (structural equality)
=_= identity (reference equality)
