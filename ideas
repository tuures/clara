### module support

start from the "entry point" file
source -> AST -> dependencyAnalyzer -> list of filenames
starting from first dependency repeat parsing + dependency analysis recursively, on every step append parsed AST
as node into a dependency tree
use post-order DFS to analyze the tree

module can either be a regular clara module (.clara) or a native JS module (.js + .d.clara)

all value and type declarations from the top level block of a module are "exported"

imports can appear any level of the code


### operators

operators are methods with non-letter name
examples:
`foo.bar` -> member (foo, member `bar`)
`foo .bar` -> member (foo, member `bar`)
`foo . bar` -> operator (foo, member `.`, apply `bar`)
`foo asd bar` -> apply (foo, apply asd, apply bar)


### equality and friends
=~ (equivalence, for example rational numbers 2/4 =~ 1/2)
== equality (structural equality)
=_= identity (reference equality)


-------------------
functional type system, case class keyword implemented as macro that is a "template" for making new types
macro is a function in type level

std lib

- list.soleHead return the head if list has just one item (combined head + assert length == 1)

if-else, ::match

x < 5 then 1 else 0

x < 5 ::match {Â true => 1, false => 0}

Nullary methods:

::methods Boolean {
  not: => Boolean

default type for any type (in pattern)
might only make sense for records

(a = 1, b = 1) = fooTuple2

{ a = 1, b = 2 } = fooRecord

(a = 1) = ()

Constructor is a first class function

- `::new T` expression returns the function

List of languages to look at for inspiration

Scala, Dotty, TypeScript, Reason/Ocaml, Rust, Swift, Nim, Python
